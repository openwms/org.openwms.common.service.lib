=== Whitebox: Common Service

The white box view gives a rough overview on how the Common Service is built internally. The service basically consists of two major
functional components, one to manage `Locations` and `LocationGroups` and another one to manage `TransportUnits`.

**Contained Building Blocks**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| app | A package that contains lifecycle components of the Common Service, without any business value
| Index Controller | This service provides an HATEOAS REST API with index resources to navigate across the primary resources
| Location Management | Functional building block to manage `Locations` and `LocationGroups`
| Transport Management | Functional building block to manage `TransportUnits` and `TransportUnitTypes`
| Location Tables | A set of database tables belong and accessed by the Location Management
| Transport Tables | A set of database tables belong and accessed by the Transport Management
|===

**Important Interfaces**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Interface** | **Description**
| REST API | The public REST API is comprised of the Location Management API, the Transport Management API and an Index that lists and delegated to those two
| Async Command API | The asynchronous Command API is exposed to trigger actions on the Location- and Transport Management resources
|===

==== Component: Location Management
As mentioned the `Location` Management cares about the resources `Location`, `LocationGroup` and `Target`. The software design of all three
primary resources is almost the same, hence the management of `Location` resources is shown here by example for the others.

All types are located in the Java package `.location` with several sub-packages.

[cols="1,2,3" options="header"]
|===
| **Component** | **Type** | **Responsibility**
| api | Package | Contains all types that are exposed and also exported to service clients
| impl | Package | Contains all types that are private and implement the solution
| spi | Package | Contains interfaces and classes that can be used to extend the service implementation
| LocationApi | Class | An exposed class that defines the `Location` API and that can be used directly ba Java clients
| LocationController | Class | Is a Spring `RestController` implementation of the `LocationApi` and resides in the main package
| LocationService | Interface | Used by the `LocationController` within the same package to avoid package dependencies (An interface is always public)
| LocationServiceImpl | Class | Spring managed transactional service that is the implementation of the business logic and the transaction boundary. In a internal package and kept package-private
| LocationRepository | Interface/Class | Either a Spring Data JPA implementation or some other technology that acts as a DAO and accesses the persistency layer in order to save and fetch `Locations`
| COM_LOCATION | Database Table | The database table accessed by the repository, either mapped or directly accessed
| Extension Point | <abstract> | This could be some interface that is used by the business logic to break out the standard processes and allow some kind of extensions
