# Purpose
This service provides essential functionality to deal with `Locations`, `LocationGroups` and `TransportUnits`. An often referred example is
the ability to move a `TransportUnit` from a `Location` A to a `Location` B.

# Build
The module depends on OpenWMS.org CORE dependencies and one additional optional COMMON dependency that is only used in the enterprise
version and offers an additional API for the UI.

![MavenDependencies][2]

Build a runnable fat jar with the execution of all unit and in-memory database integration tests, but without a required [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)
server to run: 

```
$ ./mvnw package
```

To also build and run with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) support call:

```
$ ./mvnw package -DsurefireArgs=-Dspring.profiles.active=ASYNCHRONOUS,TEST
```

This requires a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) server running locally with default settings.

# Run
This is a library not a standalone microservice that runs on the JVM. This library is part of the OpenWMS.org Common Service, that is
distributed as Docker image and can be instantiated as Docker container.

## Run as Docker Container
Instead of building the software from the sources and run it as Java program on the JVM it must be fetched as a Docker image from 
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openwms/org.openwms.common.service) and started as a Docker container.

```
$ docker run openwms/org.openwms.common.service:latest
```

# Release
Releasing a new stable version of the software to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/) is usually done by the service maintainers
only. To build an optimized and signed binary version and upload it to the Sonatype Staging Repository call: 

```
$ ./mvnw deploy -Prelease,gpg
```
After it is uploaded, Sonatype runs a couple of quality checks before it can be manually released to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).

## Release Documentation
To release the API documentation as a static website manually just call the following two Maven commands. This is integrated into the
automated build pipeline as well.

```
$ ./mvnw package -DsurefireArgs=-Dspring.profiles.active=ASYNCHRONOUS,TEST
$ ./mvnw site scm-publish:publish-scm
```
