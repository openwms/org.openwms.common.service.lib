== LocationType
A `LocationType` represents the type of a `Location`. Each `Location` must belong to one and only one specific `LocationType`. The type
definition basically defines physical dimensions of all `Location`s of this type. Usually `LocationTypes` are created statically when a
project is set up. Types may be changed, but not deleted at runtime, because every `Location` is assigned to one `LocationType` only.

[[loctype-index]]
=== LocationType Index
The `LocationType` Index with all possible operations can be retrieved with the following GET request:

include::{generated}/loctype-index/http-request.adoc[]

The response lists all the operations with a name and the corresponding href link:

[[loctype-findbypkey]]
=== Find a LocationType by its Persistent Id (pKey)
To query a `LocationType` by it's technical persistent identifier, a `GET` request is send to the `LocationType` resource along with the
`pKey` as part of the URI.

include::{generated}/loctype-findbypkey/http-request.adoc[]

The server responds with the existing `LocationType`
include::{generated}/loctype-findbypkey/http-response.adoc[]
include::{generated}/loctype-findbypkey/response-fields.adoc[]

If no `LocationType` with the given `name` exists the response looks like
include::{generated}/loctype-findbypkey-404/http-response.adoc[]

[[loctype-findbytypename]]
=== Find a LocationType by its name
To query a `LocationType` by it's unique name, a `GET` request is sent to the `LocationType` resource along with the `name` as query
parameter.

include::{generated}/loctype-findbytypename/http-request.adoc[]

The server responds with the existing `LocationType`
include::{generated}/loctype-findbytypename/http-response.adoc[]

If no `LocationType` with the given `name` exists the response looks like
include::{generated}/loctype-findbytypename-404/http-response.adoc[]

[[loctype-findall]]
=== Find all existing LocationTypes
If a client wants to get a list of all existing `LocationTypes`, a simple `GET` request to the plural resource is required. Notice that no
paging nor sorting is implemented in the API, because the expected retrieved data is less than a hundred entries.

include::{generated}/loctype-findall/http-request.adoc[]

The server responds with the existing `LocationTypes` or an empty list:
