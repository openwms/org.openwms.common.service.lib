[[section-location]]
== Location
A `Location` represents a physical or virtual place in a warehouse. Could be something like a storage location in the stock or a location on
the conveyor. Even error locations can be represented with the `Location`. Multiple `Locations` with same characteristics are grouped to a
`LocationGroup`.

A `Location` is identified by the 5-tuple coordinate, the LocationID, as well as a persistent key (the pKey). The PLC Code is an additional
identifier of a `Location` that might be null in project setups. It is the identifying name a PLC unit uses in automatic warehouses - not
used in manual warehouses.

A `Location` always belongs to a `LocationGroup` where the name of that group is stored in the `locationGroupName` property.

A `Location` can be a `Target` to send `TransportUnits` to, i.e. the target of an automatic `TransportOrder` or a manual `Movement`.

Multiple state properties with different meaning exist for a `Location`. The `plcState` is exclusively managed by the PLC in automatic
warehouses. Any error signaled by the PLC are stored on this field with a value greater than 0. Two other state fields `incomingActive` and
`outgoingActive` are used to control the material flow control of this `Location`. If `incomingActive` is set to `false`, the particular
`Location` is not considered in Inbound activities, like Putaway. Whereas the `outgoingActive` can be set to `false` to lock Outbound
operations off this `Location`.

The API allows to search for `Locations` and to mutate the `Locations` state.

[[location-index]]
=== Location Index
The Location Index with all possible operations can be retrieved with the following GET request:

include::{generated}/loc-index/http-request.adoc[]

The response lists all the operations with a name and the corresponding href link:

include::{generated}/loc-index/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-create]]
=== Create a Location
Usually `Locations` are created as static reference data when the project is setup. It is not intended to create a `Location` during normal
warehouse operation. Warehouse locations are fixed and do only change when the warehouse is extended, therefore it makes less sense to
create `Locations` on the fly or delete them in operation.

Nevertheless there is an API to create a `Location` via the REST API that might be used for automatic data migration from a legacy system to
OpenWMS.org.

A client sends a `POST` request with the `Location` representation in the request body
include::{generated}/loc-created/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/loc-created/request-fields.adoc[]

If the server has successfully created the `Location` the response looks like
include::{generated}/loc-created/http-response.adoc[]
include::{generated}/loc-created/response-fields.adoc[]

[[location-updatelocation]]
=== Update an existing Location
It's also possible to modify an existing `Location`. Therefore the client sends a `PUT` request with the full representation of the
`Location` resource, including the necessary identifier fields.

include::{generated}/loc-updated/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/loc-updated/request-fields.adoc[]

If the server has updated the `Location` successfully the response looks like
include::{generated}/loc-updated/http-response.adoc[]
include::{generated}/loc-updated/response-fields.adoc[]

[[location-findbypkey]]
=== Find Location by Persistent Id (pKey)
To lookup a `Location` identified by it's technical persistent identifier, a client needs to have the identifier on hand and must send a
`GET` request to the identifying URI:

include::{generated}/loc-find-pKey/http-request.adoc[]

If the `Location` exists the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-pKey/http-response.adoc[]

If no `Location` resource with the requested persistent identifier exists, the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-pKey-404/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-findbycoordinate]]
=== Find Location by Coordinate
Send a HTTP `GET` request with the 5-tuple coordinate as query parameter to find a `Location` identified by this coordinate.

include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate/http-request.adoc[]

If the `Location` exists the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate/http-response.adoc[]

If the `Location` with the requested coordinate does not exist, the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-404/http-response.adoc[]

If the passed coordinate is not well formatted and rejected by the server the response looks like
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-400/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-findbycoordinate-wc]]
=== Find Location by Coordinate with Wildcards
The API to search for `Locations` also accepts typical SQL wildcards in each part of the 5-tuple coordinate. Let's assume one searches for
all elevator `Locations` in the Flat Good area, a query could look like this
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-wildcard/http-request.adoc[]

In this case the Flat Good area has only 2 elevator positions and the server returns both
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-wildcard/http-response.adoc[]

If the search query did not find any `Locations` the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-wildcard-404/http-response.adoc[]

This wildcard query API can also be used to find and return all existing `Locations` just by not passing any wildcard at all
include::{generated}/loc-find-coordinate-wildcard-all/http-request.adoc[]

[[location-findbyerpcode]]
=== Find Location by ERP code
Send a HTTP `GET` request with the ERP code as query parameter to find a `Location` identified by this ERP code.

include::{generated}/loc-find-erp/http-request.adoc[]

If the `Location` exists the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-erp/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-findbyplccode]]
=== Find Location by PLC code
Send a HTTP `GET` request with the PLC code as query parameter to find a `Location` identified by this PLC code.

include::{generated}/loc-find-plc/http-request.adoc[]

If the `Location` exists the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-plc/http-response.adoc[]

If no `Location` with the requested PLC code exists, the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-find-plc-404/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-forlocationgroup]]
=== Find Locations that belong to a LocationGroup
Send a HTTP `GET` request with the name of a `LocationGroup` as query parameter to find all `Locations` that belong to this group.

include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg/http-request.adoc[]

The server responds with the list of all `Locations` - the name of the `LocationGroup` is not validated.
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg/http-response.adoc[]

If no `Locations` exist that belong to the given `LocationGroup` the server responds:
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg-404/http-response.adoc[]

The server accepts multiple `LocationGroup` names as request parameter to get a combined list of `Locations` that belong to groups with name
`ZILE` and `FGRECEIVING`:
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg-multiple/http-request.adoc[]

Returns
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg-multiple/http-response.adoc[]

Wildcards in the `LocationGroup` name are supported if only one `LocationGroup` name is provided:
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg-wc/http-request.adoc[]

The response is a list of `Locations` that belong to a `LocationGroup` where the name starts with `IP` (matching the groups `IPOINT`,
`IPOINT1` and `IPOINT2` in this example:
include::{generated}/loc-find-in-lg-wc/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-changestate]]
=== Change a Location's State
Send a HTTP `PATCH` request with the persistent identifying key of the existing `Location` along with the new state decoded as `errorCode`
request parameter.

include::{generated}/loc-state-404/http-request.adoc[]

If the `Location` with the given persistent key does not exist, the server responds with
include::{generated}/loc-state-404/http-response.adoc[]

The `errorCode` contains a ternary error bitmap that decodes all state information. It is expected as 8-digit String with allowed symbols
`*|0|1`. Each digit is assigned to one of the state attribute of the `Location` resp. `LocationGroup`:

|===
| Digit Position (RtL) | Assigned attribute

| 2^0^                 | Location.incomingActive
| 2^1^                 | Location.outgoingActive
| 2^2^                 | Location.groupStateIn
| 2^3^                 | Location.groupStateOut
|===

The following table shows all accepted decodings of the `ErrorCodeVO.errorCode` String that is sent as part of the request body:
|===
| ErrorCode String                                                                   | Description

| `{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}` | Content is ignored
| `{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}00`                   | Release Location for Inbound and Outbound operations
| `{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}01`                   | Lock Inbound operation to the Location
| `{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}10`                   | Lock Outbound operation from the Location
| `{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}{asterisk}11`                   | Lock Inbound and Outbound operation for the Location
|===

In this example a `Location` identified with the given persistent key is locked for Inbound operations with the following request:
include::{generated}/loc-state-in/http-request.adoc[]

If the server could lock the `Location` successfully the response looks like
include::{generated}/loc-state-in/http-response.adoc[]

And in addition the `Location` can be identified by coordinate instead of pKey when the state shall be changed. Then the request could look
like
include::{generated}/loc-state-in-id/http-request.adoc[]

Beside locking the `Location` for Inbound- and Outbound processing it is also possible to change the PLC state of the `Location` through
this API. Therefore the `ErrorCodeVO` data structure contains a property `plcState` that can be set to a numeric integer value. Usually a
PLC state of `0` means the `Location` is not blocked and available for any operation. A PLC may set the state to a value greater than 0 to
signal an error occurred on the `Location`.

Set the `plcState` to `31` (In terms of https://interface21-io.gitbook.io/osip[OSIP] this means `Location unexpected occupied`):
include::{generated}/loc-plcstate/http-request.adoc[]

If the server could set the state successfully the response is
include::{generated}/loc-plcstate/http-response.adoc[]

Also both is possible in one request, changing the `Locations` state and the `plcState`:
include::{generated}/loc-plcstate-both/http-request.adoc[]

If the server could set both states successfully the response is
include::{generated}/loc-plcstate-both/http-response.adoc[]

[[location-delete]]
=== Delete a Location
An existing `Location` can be deleted via the API. Therefor a client sends an HTTP `DELETE` request to the identifying URI of the resource.

include::{generated}/loc-deleted/http-request.adoc[]

The server tries to delete the resource and if successful the server responds with:
include::{generated}/loc-deleted/http-response.adoc[]

If a `Location` is not allowed to be deleted because there is either a `TransportUnit` or a `PackagingUnit` booked onto it, or it is used
somehow else in the system (for example in routing definitions etc.) the server declines the request.

In this case a request to a forbidden resource looks like:
include::{generated}/loc-deleted-403/http-request.adoc[]

The server rejects to delete the `Location` and responds with:
include::{generated}/loc-deleted-403/http-response.adoc[]
