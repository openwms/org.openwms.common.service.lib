== TransportUnit
A TransportUnit is an item like a box, a toad, a bin or a pallet that is moved within a warehouse and can carry goods. It is moved between
`Locations`.

[[transportunits-index]]
=== TransportUnit Index
The index with all possible operations can be retrieved with the following `GET` request:

include::{generated}/tu-index/http-request.adoc[]

The response lists all the operations with a name and the corresponding href link:

include::{generated}/tu-index/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-create]]
=== Create a TransportUnit
Currently the API offers two variants to create a `TransportUnit`. Both expect a HTTP `POST` request sent to the same context path but with
different request parameters.

The simplest way to create a `TransportUnit` is to just pass the mandatory fields of a `TransportUnit` to the API
include::{generated}/tu-create-simple/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-create-simple/query-parameters.adoc[]

The server stores a `TransportUnit` instance with the given values and default values for other fields. The response contains a link to the
newly created resource as HTTP `Location` header attribute
include::{generated}/tu-create-simple/http-response.adoc[]

In a second approach the client may pass the structure of the `TransportUnit` to create as request body to the API
include::{generated}/tu-create-full/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-create-full/query-parameters.adoc[]

Like before the server responds with a link to the newly created resource as soon as the operation succeeds.
include::{generated}/tu-create-full/http-response.adoc[]

Notice the `strict` attribute. When the client passes `true` as value the server ensures there that no `TransportUnit` with the given
business key exists befor. When the attribute is omitted or set to `false` no such validation happens and the reference to an already
existing `TransportUnit` or the newly created one is returned. If the API call fails because a `TransportUnit` with the given `Barcode`
exists, the response looks like
include::{generated}/tu-create-error/http-response.adoc[]

If the request is invalid or contains invalid fields the server responds with
include::{generated}/tu-create-invalid/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-move]]
=== Move a TransportUnit
To move a `TransportUnit` from it's current Location to a new Location, simply call the API with the identifying Barcode and the new
Location where the `TransportUnit` shall be moved to.

include::{generated}/tu-move/http-request.adoc[]

include::{generated}/tu-move/query-parameters.adoc[]

The server returns the updated `TransportUnit` instance.

include::{generated}/tu-move/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-modify]]
=== Modify a TransportUnit
Already existing `TransportUnits` can be modified to some degree. Not every attribute is allowed to change but most of the non-identifying
ones can be changed. For example, it is not allowed to change the Barcode of an existing `TransportUnit`, nor the internal persistent key.
The timestamp when the `TransportUnit` has been moved recently is only changed along with the `actualLocation`.

Send a HTTP `PUT` request to the server together with the `TransportUnit` as part of the request body
include::{generated}/tu-update/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-update/query-parameters.adoc[]

If the server saved the changes, the response contains the updated representation of the `TransportUnit`
include::{generated}/tu-update/http-response.adoc[]

In case no `TransportUnit` with the Barcode exists the server returns an error
include::{generated}/tu-update-404/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-changestate]]
=== Change the state of a TransportUnit
A `TransportUnit` is always in a certain state, for example `AVAILABLE`, `BLOCKED` or `QUALITY_CHECK`. A state change can be triggered
through the API by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the resource with the new state as action part of the URI.

To block a `TransportUnit` a caller might call the `/block` action:
include::{generated}/tu-block/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-block/query-parameters.adoc[]

To unblock a `TransportUnit` a caller might call the `/available` action:
include::{generated}/tu-unblock/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-unblock/query-parameters.adoc[]

And to mark the `TransportUnit` in state `QUALITY_CHECK` the caller might call the `/quality-check` action:
include::{generated}/tu-quality-check/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-quality-check/query-parameters.adoc[]

Additionally, a generic API endpoint exist, beside the three dedicated ones. This is especially useful when the list of possible states has
been extended in a project by arbitrary states. Then a caller can request a state change by calling the HTTP `POST` API:
include::{generated}/tu-state-change-na/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-state-change-na/query-parameters.adoc[]

If the server accepts a state change and performs it accordingly the response looks like:
include::{generated}/tu-state-change/http-response.adoc[]

The server might have a state change approval registered to validate each state change. So, if a `TransportUnitStateChangeApproval`
instance is registered and the server rejects to change the state of the `TransportUnit` then the response looks like:
include::{generated}/tu-state-change-na/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-findbybarcode]]
=== Find by Barcode
Find a `TransportUnit` by its unique `Barcode`.
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcode/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcode/query-parameters.adoc[]

If the `TransportUnit` has been found the server returns a JSON representation
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcode/http-response.adoc[]

In case a `TransportUnit` with the requested `Barcode` == `9999` does not exist the response looks like
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcode-404/http-response.adoc[]

Also the short form of a `Barcode` can be passed to the API and the server implementation adjusts the given `Barcode` to the configured
style, like it is left or right aligned and padded.
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcode-short/http-request.adoc[]

[[transportunits-findbybarcodes]]
=== Find by multiple Barcodes
Also multiple `Barcodes` can be passed to the API in order to search for multiple `TransportUnits`.
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcodes/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcodes/query-parameters.adoc[]

This returns an array with the `TransportUnits` found
include::{generated}/tu-find-by-barcodes/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-findonlocation]]
=== Find TransportUnits on a Location
Search and return all `TransportUnits` that are currently booked on a given `Location`.
include::{generated}/tu-find-on-location/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-find-on-location/query-parameters.adoc[]

The `TransportUnit` with `Barcode` == `00000000000000004712` is returned
include::{generated}/tu-find-on-location/http-response.adoc[]

[[transportunits-adderror]]
=== Add an Error to a TransportUnit
During the handling of `TransportUnits`, errors or failure situations may occur that makes it necessary to store some kind of error message
for further analysis. Therefore each `TransportUnit` has a history of error messages attached that can be populated with new messages. A
client simple calls an API to add a new error message to an existing `TransportUnit`.
include::{generated}/tu-add-error/http-request.adoc[]
include::{generated}/tu-add-error/query-parameters.adoc[]

The server acknowledges the request and stores the error message asynchronously
include::{generated}/tu-add-error/http-response.adoc[]
